# The Composers Toolkit

This package contains a suite of tools to assist and enrich the process of musical composition.

It is anticipated these tools will allow various different interactions that enable a composer to explore the possibilities of a given musical sample, or procedurally generated fragment.

- Libraries: defining scales, chords, pitch sets from the 12-note tempered system.
- Builder: tools for creating fixed musical sequences based upon pure procedual operations.
- Solver: tools for composing out a given fragment using a variety of machine-learning techniques, steered by operator feedback, musical constraints and heuristics.
- Analysis: the system will provide tools that yield a range of possibilities for a given musical fragment, providing the operator to quickly compare common transformations and pairings of a given chord, or melodic pattern. It will collect statisical analysis of a section of music, identifying common shapes and operations.
- Sculptor: The user is always free to make alterations, cuts and edits indpendantly of the aforementioned processes. The suite will provide tools to enable playback via a 3rd party Midi implementation of the user's choice.


As much as possible, the tools will be agnostic towards any one given interpretation, theory or style. Any ideas that depart from this will be publised in a future module (composerstoolkit-extended).
